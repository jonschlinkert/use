> Easily add plugin support to your node.js application.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save use
```

A different take on plugin handling! This is not a middleware system, if you need something that handles async middleware, [ware](https://github.com/segmentio/ware) is great for that.

## Usage

```js
var use = require('use');
```

See the [examples folder](./examples) for usage examples.
